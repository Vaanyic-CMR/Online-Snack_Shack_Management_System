# Online-Snack_Shack_Management_System

A system built for San Juan Bible Camp in Mancos, CO that tracks the inventory, account information, and purchases in their Snack Shack.

Parents can set up a balance in their child's account which can be used throughout the week to purchase snacks and merch.
Staff are also able to set up balances to store any money they may want to use.
These accounts will not be individual user accounts but rather data associated to a specific company.

This system will be an online based version of the system I am already working on as a local application (Currently Incomplete).
