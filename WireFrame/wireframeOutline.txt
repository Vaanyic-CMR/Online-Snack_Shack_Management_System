[REQUIRED] Project Title: Online | Snack Shack Management System
[REQUIRED] Project Stack: MERN
[REQUIRED] GitHub Repo Link: https://github.com/Vaanyic-CMR/Online-Snack_Shack_Management_System

[REQUIRED] Project Description: 
A system built for San Juan Bible Camp in Mancos, CO that tracks the inventory, account information, and purchases in their Snack Shack.

Parents can set up a balance in their child's account which can be used throughout the week to purchase snacks and merch.
Staff are also able to set up balances to store any money they may want to use.
These accounts will not be individual user accounts but rather data associated to a specific company.

This system will be an online based version of the system I am already working on as a local application (Currently Incomplete).

[REQUIRED] New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn:
- Relationships between models in MongoDB.
- Login/Registration and authentication.

[REQUIRED] Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2)
- Complete CRUD on server.
- Balance accounts seperated by age group / camp.

[REQUIRED] Week 2 Features (to show at first office hour/lecture of Week 3)
- ***Finish CSS work (could be Bootstrap or another framework too instead of CSS)***
- Operational transactions.
- Default: 5 seperate products can be purchased at a time.

[REQUIRED] Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...)
- Company Login/Registration.

- Inventory will track # of a product in stock (including individual clothing sizes) and when below a company determined threshold, will add product to a shopping list.
- Transactions page can add additional rows of 5 products dynamically.
- System can handle cash and partial cash transactions. Not just account transactions.
- System can handle product refunds (merch only).
- Handling remaining balances at the end of a camp based on prior parent decision:
    - A) Return remaining balance.
    - B) Donate remaining balance.
    - C) Combination of A & B.
    - D) Transfer to different account (such as another child of the same parent).

- User Login/Registration.
- Companies can add/remove individual users to their company/group and appoint admins.
- Users can access transaction handling pages for the company they are associated with and operate the system similar to a cash register.
- Including the access Users have, companies and admins of those companies can view or modify inventory and account information.

- Possibly Socket.io for up-to-date data such as inventory or active camper.
